# Simulator

- [ ] Define data structures to represent the Manchester Baby's components.
- [ ] Implement read and write functions for the memory.

- [ ] Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle:
   - [ ] Fetch the instruction from memory.
   - [ ] Decode the instruction to determine the operation and operands.
   - [ ] Execute the operation by updating the relevant components.

- [ ] Display interface:
   - [ ] Create a text-based interface to display the state of the components at each step of the execution.
   - [ ] Display the contents of accumulator, memory, and other relevant information.

- [ ] Implement operations:
   - [ ] JMP
   - [ ] JPR
   - [ ] LDN
   - [ ] STO
   - [ ] SUB
   - [ ] CMP
   - [ ] STP

- [ ] Read and parse the machine code input.

## Extensions:
### Simulator Functionality
- [ ] Add options for:
   - [ ] Increased Memory.
   - [ ] More instructions.
   - [ ] Immediate addressing.
      - [ ] Define how these addressing modes are decoded.
- [ ] Error handling:
   - [ ] Invalid instructions
   - [ ] Out-of-bounds memory access

### Other
- [ ] Develop more assembly language programs
- [ ] Create user documentation to explain how to use the simulator, its features, and the extensions.
